# PUBLIC BADGES

## Rationale

Public Badges are an evidence-based certification system for value driven
internet product and organization. As part of the
[PublicSpaces](https://publicspaces.net) initiative, our aim is to (re)establish
trust relations, between citizens, organizations, and governments. 
We are working together to reclaim the internet as a force for the common good 
and advocating a new internet that strengthens the public domain.

By combining [Open Badges](https://openbadges.org/) with automated unit tests,
we make the ethical values of organizations, products, projects, and protocols
visbile as well as measurable.

The goal of the Public Badges is not to come up with an one size fits all value
system for the internet. Instead, it is a tool to facilitate discussion about
the choice of values within a pluralist landscape and help organisations to make
the transition to a more healthy digital ecosystem. 

Public Badges are currently available to members of the PublicSpaces coalition.
If you work for a public institution, and you are interested in joining, please
get in touch with the [PublicSpaces program manager](https://github.com/leoloves) or send us an e-mail at <info@publicspaces.net>.


## Zero Badge

At the moment, there is only one badge available: the so-called Zero Badge. 
The Zero Badge serves as a public outing of support to the ideals enshrined in the PublicSpaces [manifesto](https://publicspaces.net/manifesto/). 
The badge is a clickable image that partners can put on their website that shows their support for the manifesto. 
After clicking on it, the badge will open and reveal the PublicSpaces values and the intentions of the organisation itself to work according the PublicSpaces values. 

The following text will appear: 

<strong>ZeroBadge</strong> 
This badge is awarded to organizations that publicly display their commitment to the values of the PublicSpaces manifesto on their website.
<ul>
  <li>Waag is listed in the PublicSpaces Registry</li>
  <li>Zero Badge is publicly visible on Waag's website</li>
  <li>Waag's website links to the PublicSpaces Manifesto</li>
  
</ul>


Behind the scenes, an automated technical validation will take place so that a badge cannot be displayed on a website unauthorised. 

Current organisations carrying the badge are [VPRO](https://www.vpro.nl), [Waag](https://waag.org) and [Eye Filmmuseum](https://www.eyefilm.nl/en). 
Our goal is to add the Zero Badge to the websites of multiple other PublicSpaces partners in 2021. 

The Zero Badge is only open to current members of the [PublicSpaces
Coalition](https://publicspaces.net/the-coalition/), but we aim to broaden our
scope and reach. [Become a partner of the PublicSpaces coalition.](https://publicspaces.net/join-us/) 

The current state and envisioned roadmap of the project can be found
[HERE](./state_of_the_project.md)

PublicSpaces members have to get in touch with [PublicSpaces program manager](https://github.com/leoloves) in order to apply for the app and get their website authorised. 

## Contributors

This project is in an early stage. Currently, we are not actively looking for
contributors, but that does not mean you are not welcome to reach out to us. It
may take us a bit to be ready to onboard you, but at least we can start a
conversation and get to know each other.

Since this project, involves much more than code alone, don't hesitate to get involved
if you don't know how to program at all. If all goes well, we'll need people with various
skill sets to make this project a success: writers, political theorists,
lawyers, designers, coders or just anyone who is passionate about the future of the ethical
internet and the ways we are going to govern it.

If that's you, don't hesitate to contact us at <info@publicspaces.net>. You are welcome!
